## ‚ö° Features  

- Download videos in multiple resolutions: 240p ‚Üí 4K, or best available.  
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: I have not tested downloads above 1080p, so I cannot guarantee they work. Testing higher resolutions was not possible due to certain limitations.  
- Download audio only: MP3 or FLAC, single or playlist.  
- Play videos or audio directly with `mpv`.  
- Choose specific video/audio format for download.  
- yad-based interactive menu for easy navigation.  
- Desktop notifications for download/playback progress.

### Alternative (Manual Install from Source)
- If you don‚Äôt want to use `pipx`, you can build [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) from source.

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asep5K/projek-yt.git
   cd projek-yt
   chmod +x yt.sh
   ./yt.sh
   ```
- Or, you can copy the script to a directory in your PATH, or bind it to a keybinding for easier access.

## üì± Termux (CLI Version)

1. Install from Termux package manager:
```bash
  pkg update && pkg upgrade && pkg install yt-dlp ffmpeg
  git clone https://github.com/Asep5K/projek-yt.git
  cp projek-yt/yt-termux.sh $PREFIX/bin/ytd
  chmod +x $PREFIX/bin/ytd
```
- Run the script with a direct URL
```bash
  ytd https://example.com/123456
```
- Or run the interactive menu without a URL
```bash 
  ytd
```
### üîß Tip for Linux users running the Termux CLI version

- If you want to reuse the Termux CLI script on Linux, you can:

- Change the download directory variable inside the script (DOWNLOAD_DIR=~/Videos/Downloads), or

- Create a symlink so /sdcard points to your Linux home directory:
```bash
  ln -s ~ /sdcard
```
---

## Notes
The `yt-termux.sh` script will automatically install all required packages and works on all Linux distributions.  
Simply run:

```bash
./yt-termux.sh
```
- The Makefile and build.sh are provided only for building yt-termux.sh.
